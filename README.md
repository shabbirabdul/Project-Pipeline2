### Test
#### Task 1: Run Test Cases, Measure Code Coverage, Publish Reports 

Junit test cases are run after mvn compile. We are using the sonarQube tool to generate code coverage report. Jenkins makes a call to mvn compile which automatically executes all the test cases before measuring the code coverage. 

The Jenkins sonarQube plugin displays the code coverage report on the respective Jenkins Job Page.

#### Task 2: Improve Testing Coverage

For increasing the test coverage we have used CodePro tool as an Eclipse plugin. CodePro generates test cases for class in the project.

Test coverage before improvement:

Report after improvement:

### Analysis
#### Task 3: Run Static Analysis

We have used sonarQube for static analysis of code. Every detail of the code such as number of functions, lines, directories, files, classes, statements  and accessors are tracked. SonarQube also provides SQALE ranking that tells how well a particular class or a component is written. It also tells what is the complexity /function, /file, /class.

In addition to this, sonar also provides technical issues in the code. It will classify issues in the code to major, minor, critical and blockers. The major ones and the blockers are the ones to be taken care of.

We also used Cobertura for static analysis

#### Task 4: Extended analysis

We have developed a static analysis tool that generates the number of lines of comments, code and ratio of comments to code. We have integrated it with Jenkins build, during the build this plugin is run with the path to source code as an argument. The jar file scrapes through all Java files and counts number of comments and lines in the code. The following screen shot shows comment ratio captured during jenkins build.

### Task 5: Reject commit based on testing and analysis result

Cobertura Gate

The Cobertura Jenkins Plugin allows us to reject a build if the code coverage falls beyond the mentioned threshold. The screenshot below describes the cobertura threshold used in this project that causes the build to fail due to low coverage.
